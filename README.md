# ImmuneML

ImmuneML is a software platform for machine learning analysis of immune receptor sequences.

It supports the analyses of experimental B- and T-cell receptor data,
as well as synthetic data for benchmarking purposes.

In ImmuneML, users can define flexible workflows supporting various
machine learning libraries (such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, Tensorflow, 
statsmodels), benchmarking of different approaches, numerous reports
of data characteristics, ML algorithms and their predictions, and
visualizations of results.

Additionally, users can extend the platform by defining their own data
 representations, ML models, reports and visualizations.

The platform is open-source with source code available on GitHub.

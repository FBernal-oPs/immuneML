Developer documentation
=======================

  immuneML has a modular architecture and can be easily extended with new functionalities. Specifically, see the tutorials on:

  - :ref:`How to add a new machine learning method` (which can be trained and used later for classification of immune receptors or repertoires),
  - :ref:`How to add a new encoding` (which can be a way to represent (encode) the immune receptor data so that the data can be used as input for a machine learning method or a report to provide additional insights),
  - :ref:`How to add a new report` (which can be used to examine the inner mechanisms of machine learning methods, encoded receptor data or to perform an exploratory analysis).
